# Not right Now (NrN) playlists

A Jellyfin plugin for creating smart, rule-based playlists and collections with advanced multi-user support.

Specifically designed to add the ability for you to snooze/ignore a track that gets played to often so you dont learn to hate it. 

You can choose the default setting for how long it should be ignored, default setting is 30 days.

This plugin was built off a fork of Smartlists by jyourstone (see Acknowledgments below) version 10.11.0.0. I expanded on their work to achieve the snooze function and bring the playlists to the users from admin only.

This is a personal project, if you like it you are more than welcome to use it, extend it, fork it, etc. 

As the PR for merging with the original code was rejected, I am making this a standalone plugin, and I am in the process of updating it so it doesn't appear to be a clone of Smartlists. 

Bear with me, :)



## Requirements

**Requires Jellyfin 10.11.0 or newer**

**Requires File Transformation Plugin**

This plugin requires the [File Transformation Plugin](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) to enable menu navigation for users. Without it, users can still access their configuration page directly via URL, but won't see the menu entry in Jellyfin's menu bar.

## Installation

### 1. Install File Transformation Plugin (Required)
First, install the [File Transformation Plugin](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) - this enables the user-facing sidebar navigation.

### 2. Install This Plugin

**From Repository:**
Add this repository URL to your Jellyfin plugin catalog:
```
[Repository URL TBD]
```

**Manual Installation:**
Download the latest release from the Releases page and extract to a subfolder in your Jellyfin plugins directory (e.g., `/config/plugins/[PluginName]`).

### 3. Restart Jellyfin
Restart your Jellyfin server to load both plugins.

## Usage

1. **Admin Setup**: Go to Dashboard → My Plugins → [Plugin Name] to create smart lists
2. **User Access**: Users can access their personalized settings through the user configuration pages

3. **Creating a playlist**: Build filter rules based on genre, play status, ratings, dates, and many other criteria

**Step 1**: Create a new playlist or clone an existing one and turn it into a smartlist

**Step 2**: Select media types

**Step 3**: Use rules, browse your library, or search to add media to the playlist. You can use a any combination. Rules allow for regex as well.

**Step 4**: Review and confirm the playlist. This will create a smart playlist object that you can manage in the main config screen as well as a playlist object for jellyfin.

4. **Snooze/Ignore Tracks**: Users can snooze or ignore tracks
Now, injected into the context menu, you can snooze or ignore tracks. The length of time is based on the default, which you can change in the settings.

## Acknowledgments

This project originated from the [SmartLists plugin](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartlists-plugin) by [jyourstone](https://github.com/jyourstone), which itself was based on the [SmartPlaylist plugin](https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin) by [ankenyr](https://github.com/ankenyr).

I have extended the original codebase with multi-user playlist support, track ignore functionality, and user-level configuration interfaces.
